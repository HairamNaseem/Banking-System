# Banking-System
Banking System in C programming language

•	Introduction 
We have developed a banking system which allows customers to open a bank account, apply for different kinds of loans, check their balance, check status of their account such as credit, debit, and balance in account.

•	Salient features
Customers can add money in their account
Customers can withdraw money from their account
Customers can check their balance
Customers can get loan from bank
Customers can open new account (savings account or current account)

•	Problems faced
We faced a problem of storing multiple data in files such as records of different customers which was overcome by studying filing system.

•	What is different?
We have used filing system in the project as it helps in storing multiple data of different customers which can later be accessed by them. 
Our project is inspired by different bank systems which are mostly slow and need manual updating but our banking system is up-to-date which updates records automatically at the very instant which user creates their record.

•	IDE used:
DevC++

•	Future plans:
In future we plan to add more features and make our application more accurate and one day sell it to any bank.
